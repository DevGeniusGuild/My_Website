					<h4>My First Job ASS a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>3 months after writing my first Hello World program on September 8th 2017 (While working in the marketing department) I had convinced my boss to let me take a stab at building a better version of the outdated laboratory management system my company was running on.</p>

					<p>Before I knew it we transitioned from the old system and we're on to mine. My newbie self was now in charge of hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

					<h5>My Experience as a Developer</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>
						As a fresher who embarked on my coding journey just five months ago, I quickly found myself diving headfirst into the world of development. It all began on September 8th, 2017, when I wrote my first Hello World program while still working in the marketing department.
						
						.</p>
					<p>
						
						
						Driven by curiosity and a desire to make a difference, I convinced my boss to entrust me with the task of revamping our company's outdated laboratory management system. Despite my limited experience, I embraced the challenge wholeheartedly.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>
